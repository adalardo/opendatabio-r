# Importing data using the OpenDataBio R client

The `opendatabio` R package was created to allow data from an OpenDataBio server to be read, 
and to allow data to be easily imported to an OpenDataBio server. This vignette focus on data
imports.

# Setting up the connection

The first thing to do when starting the data import is to correctly set up the connection to
the OpenDataBio server using the `odb_config()` function. The most important parameters for
this function are `base_url`, which should point to the API url for your OpenDataBio server, and
`token`, which is the access token used to authenticate your user (you can find it in the 
"Token" menu item, when using the web interface). For data imports, all requests must have
an authorization token.

```r
> cfg = odb_config(base_url = "http://opendatabio.ib.usp.br/opendatabio/api",
+ token="YourToken")
```

More advanced configuration involves setting a specific API version, a custom User Agent, or
other HTTP headers, but this is not covered in this vignette.

The function `odb_test()` may be used to check if the connection was successful, and whether
your user was correctly identified:

```r
> odb_test(cfg)
$message
[1] "Success!"

$user
[1] "admin@example.org"
```

# OpenDataBio import functions
All import functions have the same signature: the first argument is a `data.frame` with data to
be imported, and the second parameter is a configuration object (generated by `odb_config`).

When writing an import request, check the 
[OpenDataBio API endpoints documentation](https://github.com/opendatabio/opendatabio/wiki/API-v0-endpoints) in order
to understand which columns can be declared in the `data.frame`. You may also want to check the 
[OpenDataBio API documentation](https://github.com/opendatabio/opendatabio/wiki/API) to see
a list of possible errors, along with other details.

All import functions return a job id, which can be used to check if the job is still running,
if it ended with success or if it encountered an error. This job id can be used in the functions
`odb_get_jobs()`, `odb_get_affected_ids()` and `odb_get_log()`, to find details about the job,
which (if any) were the IDs of the successfully imported objects, and the full log of the job.

```r
> odb_import_people(data, cfg)
Sending ODB request (filesize = 1856)
    id    created_at (...) Status
    127   2018-03-07 (...) Submitted
> odb_get_affected_ids(127, cfg)
[1] 41 42
> odb_get_log(127, cfg)
[1] "WARNING: There is another registry of a person with name like JoÃ£o da Silva or abbreviation like SILVA, J."
```

## Importing taxons

You can import a list of taxons using the `odb_import_taxons` function. Three fields are 
currently required for a successful importation: "name", "parent" and "level". You may also
provide "valid" to indicate whether a name is accepted or not, but if you don't, all names
are supposed to be valid. Other fields may also be imported, check the API documentation
for details.

When receiving a list of species names, it is often necessary to clean up typographical errors,
capitalization, and other incorrect names. The package `taxize` can help with that.

```r
> spp = c("Ficus Schultesii", "Ficus catingae", "Ficus caballina")
> taxize::gnr_resolve(spp, canonical=TRUE, best_match_only=TRUE)[, c(1,5)]
      user_supplied_name matched_name2   
    1 Ficus Schultesii   Ficus schultesii
    2 Ficus catingae     Ficus caatingae 
    3 Ficus caballina    Ficus caballina 
```

After the species list is cleaned up, it may be transformed into a `data.table` and imported:
```r
> spp = c("Ficus schultesii", "Ficus caatingae", "Ficus caballina")
> splist = data.frame(name=spp, level="species", parent_name="Ficus")
> odb_import_taxon(splist, cfg)
```

## Importing locations

Working with spatial data is a very delicate area, so we have attempted to make the workflow
for inserting locations as easy as possible. 

### Importing latitude / longitude data
The most straightforward way to import spatial data is importing the latitude and longitude of
a point. You must convert the data to decimal representation, with positive values for North 
and East, and negative values for South and West. For instance, a point in Brasilia (Brazil)
would have latitude of -15.64 and longitude of -46.87. The required fields to import locations
are name, adm\_level and either a latitude and longitude coordinate or a full `geom` object 
(which will be detailed later). You may specify a parent location for each object to speed up
the process, but if you don't, it will be detected automatically. Other fields may also
be imported, check the API documentation for more details.

The administrative level of a location is a number denoting if the location is a country, state,
or municipality, or if it is a plot or GPS point. The number corresponding to each level may
vary depending on the country (0 is always countries, but 1 might be a state or a province),
check http://gadm.org for details. Plots and subplots have number 100, transects have number 101
and GPS points have number 999.

To import some points to the database, you can write

```r
> lat = c(-9.9482, -7.2526, -12.3749)
> long = c(-48.6371, -54.1272, -65.1819)
> name = paste("GPS point", 1:3)
> loclist = data.frame(name=name, lat=lat, long=long, adm_level = 999)
> odb_import_locations(loclist, cfg)
```

## Importing plants

To import data for marked plants, you must provide a location and tag for each, along with a project
name or id, and the date in which the plant was marked. Other recomended fields 
include the taxonomic identification and the person or people responsible for marking the plant.

The project, taxon and location must be already defined before you import plant data. The taxon and
location may be imported using the API, but the project must be defined using the web interface.

### Working with dates and incomplete dates
The date format used in OpenDataBio is year - month - day, so a valid entry would be '2018-05-28'. 
In many older collections, the exact day (or month) is not known, so you can substitute this fields with
NA: '1979-05-NA' means "an unknown day, in May 1979", and '1979-NA-NA' means "unknown day and month, 1979".

To import some plants, you can write

```r
> location = c("GPS point 2", "GPS point 1")
> tag = c("001","002")
> date = c("2017-08-09", "2017-05-NA")
> taxon = c("Abarema acreana", "Aciotis olivieriana")
> plantlist = data.frame(location=location, tag=tag, date=date, taxon=taxon, project="Rare species of the Para region")
> odb_import_plants(plantlist, cfg)
```
